# Tourism Website Project - Junior Front-End Developer Task

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a simple and user-friendly tourism website, demonstrating your skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and basic JavaScript. The website is designed to help users explore a travel destination, view travel packages, see a gallery of images, and contact the company for more information.

Demo: - [Explore Paradise](https://parthasarathy27.github.io/Tourism-Website/index.html)
